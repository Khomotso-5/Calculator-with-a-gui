In this application we are using JLabels to display what you should enter,
and we are also using JTextFields for entering values, then we have a JTextArea 
which will be used to output the total/sum of the numbers.
We also have 3 JButtons naming Calculate, Clear and Exit.
The calculate button will calculate the sum of the 2 numbers entered then display them
add the TextArea. Then the clear button clears the textfields so that the user can enter
again then the exit button disposes the frame.
Please try it.
